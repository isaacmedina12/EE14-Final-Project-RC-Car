## Overview

This project showcases a remote-controlled (RC) car developed as the final project for EE14 at Tufts University. The system integrates an STM32 microcontroller with ESP32 modules to facilitate low-latency wireless control. The STM32 captures joystick inputs and sends them over UART to an ESP32, relaying the data via ESP-NOW to a second ESP32 on the car. The receiving ESP32 then sends the data via UART to the receiving STM32, which interprets that data and sets the turn angle (servo motor) and the speed of the DC motor. 



## Features

- **Dual-MCU Architecture**  
  - STM32L432KC handles analog joystick sampling and UART framing  
  - ESP32 modules handle wireless ESP-NOW communication  

- **Low-Latency Wireless**  
  - ESP-NOW peer-to-peer protocol for sub-millisecond packet delivery  

- **Modular Code Structure**  
  - Separate folders for transmitter (STM32), intermediary (ESP32), and receiver (ESP32)  
  - Clear build instructions for each  

## Hardware
- **Microcontrollers**
  - 2 STM32L432KCs. One for input data, and one for output to the motors.
  - 1 ESP-WROOM-32 (Used for transmission)
  - 1 ESP32-C3-WROOM-02 (Used for receiving data)
  - 1 Analog Joystick Board
  - 1 TB6612FNG H-Bridge
  - 1 Servo Motor
  - 1 Tamiya 72005 6-Speed Gearbox Kit DC Motor
  - 1 7.4V, 1000mAh/25C LiPo battery
  - 1 LM2596 Buck Converter
  - 100µF and 10µF capacitors

## Software
- **Transmitter Side**
  - The transmitter side STM32 The transmitter-side STM32 uses its ADC to read analog joystick inputs (X and Y axes), packages them into a 4-byte struct, and sends the data over UART to the ESP- 
    WROOM-32.
  - The ESP-WROOM-32 transmitter decodes the bytes using a state machine and relays the data to a receiving ESP32 using the ESP-NOW wireless protocol.
- **Receiver Side**
  - The receiver-side ESP32 unpacks the struct and forwards it over UART to the second STM32.
  - The receiving STM32 interprets the data:
    - The X-axis controls the servo angle for steering via PWM.
    - The Y-axis controls motor direction (via H-bridge polarity) and speed (via PWM)
- **Tools and Langauges**
  - STM32s were programmed in Embedded C using PlatformIO.
  -  ESP32s were programmed in C++ using the Arduino IDE.
  -  Data is transmitted as a 4-byte struct: two bytes for the joystick’s X value and two for the Y value, using little-endian formatting.
